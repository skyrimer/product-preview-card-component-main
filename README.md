## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [HTML Picture tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - Since it has somewhat unique attributes, it is easy to forget how to use `picture`{.html} tag.
- [Complete guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Despite me using `display: grid`{.css} for the main container, flexbox has lower degree of entry and therefore, its easier to use. Nonetheless, you still need to learn itðŸ˜Š.
